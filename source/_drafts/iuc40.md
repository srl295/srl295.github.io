I'll start, and could almost end, my post with this tweet:

Yes, that exactly. November 1-3, 2016 was the 40<sup>th</sup> [Unicode conference](http://www.unicodeconference.org).
They used to be [twice a year, in multiple locations](http://www.unicodeconference.org/past-conferences.htm), as in,
outside of Santa Clara, California, USA.

Now that the conference is over, I‚Äôll have to take some time to view slides from all of the
[other great presentations](http://www.unicodeconference.org/program.htm) I missed while
giving a personal record number of talks (long story), apart from the lightning talks which 
were apparently not recorded.

The conference, and Unicode in general, is about _people_. It is always great to see so many
folks I've kept up with over the years‚Ä¶¬†including of course my fellow IBMers from
many time zones away.

Off the top of my head, the important technical (besides personal) conversations
