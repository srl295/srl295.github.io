> Let me tell you the story<br>
> Of a Promise named Charlie,<br>
> On an un Exceptional day.<br>
> He put ten strings on the socket,<br/>
> reniced some child process<br>
> went to [`require('mbta')`](https://npmjs.com/package/mbta/)
>
>> _Chorus_<br/>
>> Did he ever resolve,<br/>
>> No he never resolved<br/>
>> and his fate is still unsolv’d<br/>
>> He’s been `<pending>` forever<br/>
>> on that un-called closure<br/>
>> He’s the Promise that never resolved
>
> Charlie yielded his time<br/>
> somewhere down in `libuv`<br/>
> and he queued in<br/>
> th’event loop main.<br/>
> When he got called the constructor told him<br/>
> “one more bracket”<br/>
> Charlie couldn’t reach `then()` again
>
> “Only one more build,”<br/>
> said the rock star coder<br/>
> “I’ll replace four lines with three”<br/>
> But, alas, `git merge`<br/>
> of the branch to `master`<br/>
> And the Promise sailed out to sea!<br/>
> 
> Oh the DevOps ninja<br/>
> Checks new builds in production<br/>
> Every day at quarter past two<br/>
> And through the open window<br/>
> Charlie’s newlines are sandwiched<br/>
> And the log goes rumbling through!<br/>
