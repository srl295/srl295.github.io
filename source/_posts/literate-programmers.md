Besides the Globalization Pipeline mug, one of my favorite coffee mugs says:

{% asset_img IMG_0010.jpg 03: MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PROGRAMMERS TO WRITE IN ENGLISH AND YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT PROGRAMMERS CANNOT WRITE IN ENGLISH. %}

On the serious side, we need to emphasize communication skills in the technology industry. Even if I have a great idea, if I can’t communicate it, it will go nowhere. And neither will I.

Just to be clear, by “communication” I mean “talking with other humans”. Which brings me to today’s topic on the lighter side, and that is the overloading of English.
Words such as _function_, _overload_, _network_, _build_ all have specific meanings that weren’t originally found in [Webster’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster's_Dictionary#First_edition_1828).
The 1828 definition of _computer_, for example, is:

> _One who computes; a reckoner; a calculator._

In i18n, there are other words that have very specific meanings: _global_, _globalization_, _collation_, _contraction_, and of course _locale_, just to name a few. 

To that end, I have started to add some tongue-in-cheek “redefinitions” to the [bottom of the blog](#rdfooter) just to remind us all that these words have non-software meanings.
